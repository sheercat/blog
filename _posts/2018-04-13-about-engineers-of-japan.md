Hello this is new blog for me.

However, since I can not think of anything to write, I will write about the characteristics of Japanese engineers. I'm sorry, but let's see it together.

Japanese engineers can be categorized into the following types.

1. Super engineer.
    This engineer is very few in Japan. 
    Because engineers with great skills in Japan usually go to work in San Francisco.

2. Middle engineer.
    Indeed, there are very few engineers of this type in Japan too.
    Because engineers with better skills in Japan usually go to work in San Francisco.

3. Poor engineer.
    In fact, Most engineers in Japan are engineers of this type.

Why is this happening in the workplace environment in Japan?
